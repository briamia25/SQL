-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. Then, I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

-- Creating a table

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

--Then I insterted the Spotify Data .csv into the table. 
-- Next, I explored the data using the following SQL:

--First, I viewed all columns in the databse.
SELECT * FROM Spotifydata 

--Then, I determined how many songs were in the database.
SELECT count(id)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata 

-- I determined who the Top 20 artists were by popularity.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata 
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 20

--I found the popularity, danceability, and energy of the most popular song. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, danceability, energy
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata 
WHERE track_name = "good 4 u"

-- I determined who the top 5 most popular artists were. 
SELECT artist_name, avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata 
group by artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5

--I found the avg danceability and energy of songs by Ed Sheeran.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(danceability), avg(energy)
From BIT_DB.spotifydata
Where artist_name = 'Ed Sheeran'


-- I determined the avg danceability, energy, and popularity of all the artists. 
SELECT artist_name, avg(danceability), avg(energy), avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
Group by artist_name
Order by popularity desc


-- Then, I determined which artists had more than one song listed.
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name) as number_of_songs, avg(popularity)
From BIT_DB.spotifydata
Group by artist_name
Having count(artist_name) > 1 

--Finally, I viewed the songs of artists who had more than one song. 
Select artist_name, track_name
From BIT_DB.spotifydata
Order by artist_name
